# prepare-data-lakes
This repository contains the code that was used to fetch, clean and prepare
different data sets. 

Given that each dataset source has its own quirks and particularities, different
datasets have different requirements and utilities. 

Most of the exploratory analysis is done in `notebooks`, however when possible 
the code is moved to ad-hoc python files. 

Current data sets considered:
- D3M
- GitTables
- D3M+Auctus
- Kaggle/company-employees
- Kaggle/the-movies-dataset
- Kaggle/us-accidents
- YAGO3
